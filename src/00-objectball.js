// ### Function Building

// * Build a function, `numPointsScored` that takes in an argument of a player's name and returns the number of points scored for that player.
//   * Think about where in the object you will find a player's `points`. How can
//     you iterate down into that level? Think about the return value of your
//     function.
// * Build a function, `shoeSize`, that takes in an argument of a player's name and returns the shoe size for that player.
//   * Think about how you will find the shoe size of the correct player. How can
//     you check and see if a player's name matches the name that has been passed
//     into the function as an argument?
// * Build a function, `teamColors`, that takes in an argument of the team name
//   and returns an array of that teams colors.
// * Build a function, `teamNames`, that operates on the game object to return an
//   array of the team names.
// * Build a function, `playerNumbers`, that takes in an argument of a team name
//   and returns an array of the jersey number's for that team.
// * Build a function, `playerStats`, that takes in an argument of a player's name
//   and returns a object of that player's stats.
//   * Check out the following example of the expected return value of the `playerStats` function:

//     ```js
//     playerStats("Alan Anderson")
//     {
//       number: 0,
//       shoe: 16,
//       points: 22,
//       rebounds: 12,
//       assists: 12,
//       steals: 3,
//       blocks: 1,
//       slamDunks: 1
//     }
//     ```

// * Build a function, `bigShoeRebounds`, that will return the number of rebounds
//   associated with the player that has the largest shoe size. Break this one
//   down into steps:
//   * First, find the player with the largest shoe size
//   * Then, return that player's number of rebounds
//   * Remember to think about return values here. Use `debugger` to drop into
//     your function and understand what it is returning and why.


// **Bonus Questions:**

// Define functions to return the answer to the following questions:

// 1. Which player has the most points? Call the function `mostPointsScored`.
// 2. Which team has the most points? Call the function `winningTeam`.
// 3. Which player has the longest name? Call the function `playerWithLongestName`.

// **Super Bonus:**

// 1. Write a function that returns true if the player with the longest name had
//    the most steals. Call the function `doesLongNameStealATon`.
